# Biocanvas
A beginner-friendly, integrated educational pipeline for protein–ligand interaction analysis

# Biocanvas

Biocanvas is an educational web-based prototype designed to help biotechnology students understand
protein–ligand interactions through an integrated, beginner-friendly pipeline.

## Problem
Computational drug discovery tools are fragmented and difficult for beginners to use.
EduDock integrates key steps into a single guided workflow.

## Features
- Protein selection from curated database
- 3D structure retrieval from AlphaFold DB
- Simplified docking simulation
- Visual interaction analysis
- AI-generated educational explanations

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: Bubble
- Backend: Bubble Backend Workflows
- Protein Structures: AlphaFold DB
- Visualization: Mol*
- AI Explanation: OpenAI API

## Disclaimer
This project is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only and is not suitable
for real drug discovery or clinical use.
